# poc-yodoc

PoC of [yodoc](https://github.com/suzuki-shunsuke/yodoc).

Execute yodoc via GitHub Actions and update documents automatically.

- When a pull request is merged into the default branch, all documents are removed once and regenerated by yodoc. If documents are changed, a pull request is created
  - Before regenerating documents, the pull request author and title are checked to prevent the infinite loop
  - If CI fails, a pull request comment is posted to the original pull request to notify the failure
- When a pull request is created automatically, `auto-merge` gets enabled to merge the pull request automatically
